# Reading List API
Hello! Thank you for your interest in joining our engineering team at Hokodo.

We ask all candidates to complete this short exercise to help us evaluate their suitability for the roles we are recruiting for. We recommend spending between 2 and 4 hours. You will have an opportunity to discuss your solution, and the choices you made at the next interview stage, what you would have done with more time, what the next steps would be, etc.

## The Exercise
Create a simple, 2 endpoint JSON api that fetches data from an external source.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Fetch data from https://hokodo-frontend-interview.netlify.com/data.json
* Endpoint `/books` should return a collection of books
* Endpoint `/books` should be capable of returning data sorted by publication date, ascending and descending
* Endpoint `/books` should be capable of returning data sorted alphabetically by title, ascending and descending
* Endpoint `/authors` should return a collection of authors, each author item should contain a collection of their books

### Requirements
A good solution will
* satisfy the acceptance criteria
* have good test coverage
* use _appropriate_ libraries
* be production ready

Please send us your solution or put it on a repository hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and don't forget to include a README file to tell us how to build and run the application :)
